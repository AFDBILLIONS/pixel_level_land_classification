    "The notebooks in this folder contain a tutorial illustrating how to create a deep neural network model that accepts an aerial image as input and returns a land cover label (forested, water, etc.) for every pixel in the image and deploy it in ESRI's [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/) software. Microsoft's [Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-toolkit/) is used to train and evaluate the model on an [Azure Geo AI Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch-ai/). The method shown here was developed in collaboration between the [Chesapeake Conservancy](http://chesapeakeconservancy.org/), [ESRI](https://www.esri.com), and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research/) as part of Microsoft's [AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/aiforearth) initiative.\n",

    "We recommend budgeting two hours for a full walkthrough of this tutorial. The code, shell commands, trained models, and sample images provided here may prove helpful even if you prefer not to complete the tutorial: we have provided explanations and direct links to these materials where possible."
